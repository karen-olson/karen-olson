### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Karen Olson (she/her).
### I'm a Full Stack Engineer with DevSecOps capabilities, language nerd, fitness enthusiast, and creative dabbler.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** preparing to migrate a Title Insurance company's tech (AWS, DataDog, Looker, and more) due to an acquisition.

    As the only full-time developer on the project, I'm also handling security, bug fixes, and infra maintenance.
  
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning about** tuning DataDog SIEM services and migrating an AWS Account between Organizations.
  
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** my previous career as a speech-language therapist (i.e. "communication specialist").
  
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I lived in Japan for 2 years as a middle schooler.
